# Analysis of the Goalkeeper in the 2019/2020 Season

This repository consists of an analysis of all the goakeepers in the Premier League who had recorded more than 6 games. The analysis goes beyond common metrics like Save Percentage and Clean Sheets. With the use of StatsBomb's Expected Goals model, I'll cover metrics like Post Shot Expected Goals +/-, Goals Saved Above Average (GSAA) and Goals Saved Above Expectation (GSAE).

This analysis is conducted with inspiration by José Pérez (https://twitter.com/jcperez_?lang=da).
